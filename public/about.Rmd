## Hello! 

Hope you like my page so far. I recently completed my Bachelor's at Northwestern University in Statistics and Economics. I am interested in interdisciplinary research and statistics/data-science related opportunities. I'm also interested in practicing data analysis and learning more about what I can do with and discover from data. 
<br><br>
After graduating from an arts high school, I came to Northwestern interested in Voice and History. I soon realized my love for Statistics and the ability to use Mathematics to learn more about our world. Be sure to look at my Posts and Resume if you're interested in my skillset. 
<br><br>
My posts are either questions that I try to answer using statistical methods or exercises in topics of personal interest.
