<p>Welcome to my website! Glad you’re here.
<!--more-->
Thank you for visiting my website! I plan on posting short projects, exercises and things related to statistics and data science on my home page (which you can access by clicking my name in the top-left corner). For more information about me, my interests and why I do what I do, check out my <a href="/about/"><kbd>About</kbd></a> and <a href="/resume"><kbd>Resume</kbd></a> page.
<br><br>
If you need to look for anything, try my <a href="/search"><kbd>Search</kbd></a> page. You can view all of my posts in my <a href="/archives"><kbd>Archives</kbd></a> page.
My website was made using <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/"><kbd>blogdown</kbd></a>.
<br><br>
I tend to abuse the kbd tag. Anything that looks like <kbd>this</kbd> will link to another page on my website or a site that has more information on a package I used in a post/project. I thought it would add some personality to the hyperlinks. All other hyperlinks (sources, etc) will look light purple - nothing crazy.</p>
